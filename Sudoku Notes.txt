Solve a Sudoku puzzle where the initial state is defined by the contents of a text file with row, column and value on each line of the file. 
When finished, show the results as a 9 x 9 table on the console.

Ultimate solution, build a node.js server hit that will solve the puzzle, build a client that will display the 9x9 grid, allow the user to 
enter the initial values and send them to the server, displaying the solved puzzle when the server responds.

First attempt. 

Define a Cell class to contain information about a cell in the table
    value, 
    initialValueFlag
    [9] array of flags for potential values
    
Define a Square class containing a 3x3 grid of Cells
    [3, 3] array of Cells
    
Define a Puzzle class containing a 3x3 grid of Squares
    Need a function for finding a Cell given the over all row and column in the puzzle
    
populate the Puzzle with the initial values
for each cell in the puzzle
    set the potential value flags to true
    clear the flags for the final values found in the the cell's square, row and column
    
fValueFound = true
while fValueFound
    fValueFound = false
    for each cell in the puzzle
        fValueFound |= checkCell
if solvedPuzzle
    showPuzzle
else
    unsolvable puzzle
end
        
checkCell
    fValueFound = false
    if there is only 1 potential value
        set the value to the potential value
        clear the potential values
        for each cell in the cell's square
            fValueFound |= clearPotentialValue(value)
        for each cell in the cell's row
            fValueFound |= clearPotentialValue(value)
        for each cell in the cell's column
            fValueFound |= clearPotentialValue(value)
    return fValueFound

clearPotentialValue(value)
    clear the value from the potential values
    return checkCell
    
solvedPuzzle
    fSolved = true
    for each cell
        if cell doesn't have a value
            fSolved = false
    return fSolved
